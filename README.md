Project Description :- A user-friendly healthcare chatbot that helps to analyse the health condition of a person based on the symptoms they are suffering with, not accurately but as basic knowledge on current condition of the person health.

Important information used in the project :- 
Training dataset : 113 features , 4920 samples and Testing dataset: 113 features, 41 samples.
Label encoder is used for encoding the numericals.
Decision tree used for making decisions.

Training,Testing and Cross-validating  :- 
1.Firstly getting the health datasets from past few years that contain disease and its related symptoms.
2.Training the chatBot (AI model) to predict the disease with the given symptoms using decison tree method with training dataset.
3.Testing that trained model with testing dataset.
4.Finally , got good accuracy for the model in predicting the disease. 

Language and modules used in building the chatBot :-
Language used is python programming language . Modules used are sklearn for training the model , numpy and pandas for data reading and for conversions.  

How the chatBot works :-
After launching chatBot with greeting message , it will ask user to confirm the given symptom with yes or no if they are suffering with it . It continues until the chatBot finds a disease that matches the user symptoms confirmed. After finding the disease , the chatBot displays the disease list along with the current symptoms of the user and actual symptoms of the disease just to warn the user about the disease symptoms and its effect on them.
